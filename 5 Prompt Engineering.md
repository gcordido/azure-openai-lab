# Prompt Engineering

As we've seen, natural language Generative AI models can produce unexpected responses to prompts. Prompt Engineering is the process of adding additional content to the prompt to provide "grounding" to the AI model and make it more likely to produce the desired response.

(Another technique you can use to improve the quality of responses is a process called "[fine-tuning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/fine-tuning)", which retrains the underlying model with example prompts and responses that you provide. We don't cover fine-tuning in this workshop, primarily because prompt engineering generally produces better results, faster and more easily.)
